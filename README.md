The ITU International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters ⟨A⟩ to ⟨Z⟩,
# one accented Latin letter ⟨É⟩, the Indo-Arabic numerals ⟨0⟩ to ⟨9⟩,
# and some punctuation and messaging procedural signals (prosigns)

# The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits,
# and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits

# International Morse code is composed of five elements:[2]: §3 
#
# short mark, dot or dit ( ▄ ): "dit duration" is one time unit long
# long mark, dash or dah ( ▄▄▄ ): three time units long
# inter-element gap between the dits or dahs within a single character:
# one dit duration silence, one unit long
# short gap (between letters): one dah duration silence, three time units long
# medium gap (between words): a long silence, duration the same as two (silent)
# dahs sent with a normal one dit gap, seven time units (formerly five)
